I remember when I first tried setting an image background in CSS.

What I thought would be a simple task took me down a rabbit hole of learning 8 different `background-*` properties. It
took me hours to figure out what they all did and how they interacted.

Now, I want to teach you everything you need to know about CSS background. In minutes instead of hours.

# ðŸŽ¨ Color

**Property:** `background-color`
**Default Value:** `transparent`

The most commonly used background property. It lets us change the color of an elementâ€™s background.

The color can be specified using rgb, hsl or hex notation.

```css
/* Without Transparency */
background-color:

rgb
(
0
,
0
,
0
)
;
background-color:

hsl
(
0
,
0
%
,
0
%
)
;
background-color: #000000

;

/* With Transparency */
background-color:

rgba
(
0
,
0
,
0
,
1
)
;
background-color:

hsla
(
0
,
0
%
,
0
%
,
1
)
;
background-color: #000000ff

;
```

You can also use one of the [140 predefined colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/), or the `transparent`
keyword.

# ðŸ“· Image

**Property:** `background-image`
**Default Value:** `none`

The star of the show. Almost all other background properties modify it in some way.

It allows us to set an image as the elementâ€™s background.

To do it, use the `url()` function with a relative or absolute URL as its parameter. The URL should be wrapped in
quotes `"` or apostrophes `'`.

> **NOTE:** When you choose to go with a relative URL, remember that itâ€™s relative to the stylesheet, not the webpage.

```css
background-image:

url
(
"image.png"
)
;
```

But why canâ€™t we just write the URL without some fancy *function*? Because there are other image sources in CSS. For
example: [gradients](https://hadrysmateusz.medium.com/complete-guide-to-css-gradients-f6212760a268).

```css
background-image:

linear-gradient
(
red, yellow

)
;
```

Yeah, gradients are images in CSS. If you find this hard to remember like me, use
the [background shorthand](https://hadrysmateusz.medium.com/the-fastest-way-to-set-css-backgrounds-47e7e5e17bab). It
does the remembering for you ðŸ˜„

# Repeat

**Property:** `background-repeat`
**Default Value:** `repeat`

`background-repeat` determines what happens, if the image is smaller than the element it serves as a background for.

The possible values of `background-repeat` are better shown than told:

![Example showing the different background-repeat values](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*owqJkCZt4HMGeRBXo4S4yw.png)

# Size

**Property:** `background-size`
**Default Value:** `auto auto`

This property controls the size of the background image. Most of the time itâ€™s used with one of two keywords:

- `cover` - It fills (covers) the entire area of the element with the image, without stretching. Even if it means that
  parts of the image won't be visible.
- `contain` - The opposite of `cover`. It makes sure that the entire image fits (is contained) in the element, without
  squashing.

Unless `background-size` is set to `no-repeat`, setting `background-size: contain` will result in image tiling.

The value of `background-size` can also be a percentage or length (`px`,`cm`,`em` etc.).

A percentage value is relative to the elementâ€™s size, or more specifically the area specified by `background-origin`.
More on that property later.

`background-size` can be set using a **one-value** or **two-value** syntax.

- When only one value is provided, it sets the imageâ€™s width. Height is set automatically to preserve proportions.
- When two values are provided, the first one sets the width, and the second sets the height.

When using two values, the image might get stretched. To prevent stretching, set one value using a length/percentage and
the other using the `auto` keyword.

# Position

**Property:** `background-position`
**Default Value:** `0% 0%`

Maybe youâ€™ve noticed that when we change an elementâ€™s size, it stays glued to the top-left corner. We can change that by
using `background-position`.

There are four keywords we can use: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. As well as any length or percentage value.

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*B-WVVIQGgMPozUyWuxzK4Q.gif)

Just like `background-size`, we can use a **one-value** or **two-value** syntax.

- When using one value, it sets the imageâ€™s horizontal (x-axis) position. The vertical (y-axis) position defaults to
  50%.
- When using two values, the first sets the horizontal position and the second: vertical.

> **NOTE:** Length values set the distance of the imageâ€™s top-left corner from the elementâ€™s top-left corner. Percentage
> and keyword values set the position of the imageâ€™s mid-point on a given axis.

Combining `background-position: center` with `background-size: cover` or `contain` is an easy way to achieve responsive
images, that scale well with the element and the page.

# ðŸ“Œ Attachment

**Property:** `background-attachment`
**Default Value:** `scroll`

`background-attachment` allows you to control how your background image reacts to scrolling.

**Possible values are**:

- `scroll` - Scrolls with the page, but not with the element's contents.
- `fixed` - Fixed to the viewport. Acts like a window to something behind the page.
- `local` - Scrolls with the page and the element's contents.

If youâ€™re confused by that, donâ€™t worry. Itâ€™s tricky to understand without examples. Play around with the demo below
until you get a better feeling for how this property works.

# Origin

**Property:** `background-origin`
**Default Value:** `padding-box`

This property sets the backgroundâ€™s origin. It uses three keywords:

- `border-box` - The background starts at the outer edge of the border. It goes under it, which you can see if the
  border is semi-transparent, `dashed`, or `dotted`.
- `padding-box` - The background starts at the inner edge of the border.
- `content-box` - The background starts where the element's content does.

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*2Rcc_4LxBGe8iY8Dlde7_A.png)

This example assumes background-repeat: no-repeat;

Both `background-position` and `background-size` are relative to the box set by this property.

# Clip

**Property:** `background-clip`
**Default Value:** `border-box`

Even though `background-clip` shares most of its values with `background-origin` and their results might look similar,
they are actually quite different.

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Zkr2L1WyW1CxlY6LrGzypg.png)

This property doesnâ€™t modify the position of the background in any way.

It **clips** the background to the selected box. This means that any parts of the background outside the area set by
this property will not be visible.

- `border-box` - The background is clipped to the outer edge of the border. It will be visible under the border, padding
  and content.
- `padding-box` - The background is clipped to the inner edge of the border. It will be visible under the padding and
  content.
- `content-box` - The background is clipped to the content area. It will only be visible under the element's content.
- `text` - The background will only be visible under the element's text content. Make sure to set `color: transparent`
  to see the background. This can be used to achieve some cool effects
  like [gradient text](https://hadrysmateusz.medium.com/gradient-text-in-css-609068d3f953).

> **NOTE:** If the area set by `background-clip` is smaller than the one set by `background-origin` the outer parts of
> the image will be cut off. Make sure there's nothing important there.

# Layers

All background properties, except `background-color` accept multiple values, separated by commas. That's because every
element can have multiple background layers.

```css
background-image:

url
(
cat.png
)
,
url
(
grass-texture.jpg
)
;
background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat

;
background-attachment: scroll, local

;
background-image: green

;
```

The first (leftmost) value corresponds to the top layer. The last (rightmost) value, is the bottom layer.

But managing layers across multiple properties can get messy pretty quickly. For example: *What if you decide to add
another image layer at the top of the layer stack but forget to update other* `*background-**` *properties?*

This problem can be prevented by using
the [background shorthand](https://hadrysmateusz.medium.com/the-fastest-way-to-set-css-backgrounds-47e7e5e17bab).

I hope this introduction made this topic easier to understand, and can serve as a reference, if you ever need a
refresher.
