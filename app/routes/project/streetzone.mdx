  <p>
    This project started as a simple marketplace for enthusiasts of streetwear
    with a blog to drive traffic. It quickly expanded into a full community hub
    with rich user-interactions like follows, notifications, and real-time
    messaging.
  </p>
  <p>
    The website was designed and solo developed by me from October 2018 to
    September 2019. It is currently being rewritten to use TypeScript.

  <p>
    The frontend was built using JavaScript & React and was styled using Sass, which was eventually replaced by styled-components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Initially, the backend used Amazon Web Services including DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, and Lambda. Eventually DynamoDB proved unfit for this project, so I migrated the backend to Firebase and its Firestore database, which provided a better pricing model, simpler API, subscriptions, and more.
  </p>
  <p>The final stack includes among others:</p>

    <li>Algolia Search</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Firebase</li>
    <li>Axios</li>
  </GridList>

<PortfolioSection
  heading="Marketplace"
  id="features-marketplace"
  name="features"
  marginTop="120px"
>
  <p>
    The marketplace, like all other parts of the site use Algolia search
    indexes, kept in sync by Firebase Cloud Functions for full-text search,
    filtering, and sorting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Logged-in users looking to sell can list their items for sale and buy
    different promotional tools like “bumps” and home page slots. Users looking
    to buy can contact owners of items they want using one of their listed
    contact methods or the built in in-app messaging solution.

  <p>
    Users looking to buy can contact owners of items they want using one of
    their listed contact methods or the built in in-app messaging solution. If
    enabled by the user, receiving a message will send a browser notification as
    well as display an unread badge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously contacted users are kept in history for quick access. Additional
    care was put into making the messaging section intuitive and familiar on
    mobile devices.

  <p>
    The website has an integrated blog with categorized and tagged posts,
    searchable using Algolia. The posts are written in markdown and added via a
    custom admin interface.

    The entire website was created with mobile devices in mind and works on
    screens of any dimensions. A combination of media queries and modern layout
    methods like flexbox and CSS grid were used to achieve this. Additional care
    was put into making touch input a first-class citizen, with e.g. swipable
    carousels.

  <p>
    Although I never launched this project publicly, the hands-on experience of
    building a big app like this from scratch was well worth it. I’ve grown my
    skills writing React components, choosing technologies to fit the needs of a
    project, and so much more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coming back to rewrite this app in TypeScript taught me the value of writing
    clean, self-documenting code, which has become my priority going forward.
